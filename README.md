# Final Project: Reproducibility Challenge 

This is a project for a class at EPFL EE-441 "Fundamentals of inference and Learning"

This Repo is an attempt to reproduce the paper "Reconciling modern machine learning practice
and the bias-variance trade-of" As we found it interesting that faces one interesting topic, which is the double descent, and how the over-parametrization can help to solve machine learning problems.
